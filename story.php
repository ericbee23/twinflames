        <img src="images/Synopsis_New.jpg" alt="">
     <p>
        "Twin Flame" is a captivating coming-of-age drama that delves into self-discovery, spiritual awakening, and the power of human connections. Set against the backdrop of a vibrant, pulsating party scene, the film follows the journey of a young woman named Joanna, who, at a turning point in her life, decides to explore the mystical world of magic mushrooms.
        
        Joanna, a free-spirited and somewhat lost soul, is drawn to a house party that promises a night of adventure and self-exploration. Naomi, her adventurous friend, introduces her to magic mushrooms at the party. Initially hesitant, Joanna decides to take the plunge and embarks on a psychedelic journey that will forever alter the course of her life. 
        
        Amid the kaleidoscope of hallucinatory experiences, Joanna encounters a mysterious and enigmatic stranger named Alex. Their connection is instantaneous and profound, as if their souls had searched for one another.
        
        As the night unfolds, "Twin Flames" delves into themes of self-discovery, spirituality, and the blurred lines between reality and perception. Joanna and Alex's journey through the magic mushrooms leads them to confront their deepest fears and insecurities, ultimately bringing them closer together. Their shared experiences challenge their perspectives on life, love, and the existence of a higher, metaphysical connection between souls.

        <p>  Twin Flames is more than just a movie; it's a spiritual journey into the complexities of relationships and the alluring influence of peer pressure." My passion for this project comes from a desire to create a memorable experience that goes beyond the limits of traditional narrative. I want the audience to go on a euphoric and psychedelic experience, with emotional highs and lows all happening in one amazing night.

            This film is heavily influenced by Sam Levinson's futuristic style in 'Euphoria.' I hope to portray the same unapologetic raw energy that involves viewers at many levels of human connection. The visual and emotional impact of 'Euphoria' inspired my drive to create a story that not only speaks to the viewers but also leaves an unforgettable mark on their hearts and thoughts.
            
            The music in 'Twin Flames' is vital in defining the story's atmosphere. I chose non-vocal house music that serves as inspiration for the vibrating beats of a house party.
            
            The editing of the film is a rigorous procedure that is carefully executed to replicate the appearance and feel of the plot. I want the smooth flow of the narrative to grip the audience and make them feel as if they are a part of the main characters' terrible night. Pacing, transitions, and visual aspects are all carefully planned to enhance the overall cinematic experience.
